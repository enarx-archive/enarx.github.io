**Title**: Dr CloudLove, or how I learned to trust my CSP (not)  
**Author**: Mike Bursell  
**Date**: Tuesday, December 7, 2021, 11:00 AM - 11:45 AM  

The Cloud is just somebody else’s computer. So when you run a workload on a
cloud host, anyone who owns (or pwns) that system can look into it or 
change the data or event the application itself. You have no 
confidentiality or integrity protection from your Cloud Service 
Provider, rogue sysadmins or just anyone who compromises their machines.
Confidential computing uses hardware-based trusted execution 
environment (e.g. Intel SGX, AMD SEV or Arm 9 Realms) to provide these 
protections, but it’s difficult to use and complex to understand.

This session will introduce the problem at a technical level, explain
some of the solutions, and discuss why confidential computing is on its
way – but not an easy fix (yet). Come and be amused, horrified, and 
excited; all in one presentation.
