**Title**: Building an open company around an open source project  
**Author**: Mike Bursell  
**Date**: March 29, 2022  

Enarx is an open source security project in Confidential Computing. About 2 years after its inception, we decided to start a company around it – and we wanted to make the company open, too. What were the challenges, and how did we address them? How to balance community growth against product development? Should design and development stay in the open? How should we manage issues, PRs, documentation?

We made some mistakes along the way, we’ve done some things right, and we’re still learning, but come along to understand and join us on our journey.
