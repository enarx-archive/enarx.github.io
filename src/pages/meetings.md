Like everything else Enarx, these meetings are fully public, and you are more than welcome to join us. If you're a new attendee, please introduce yourself! We promise we won't bite. :slightly_smiling_face: We'll also be happy to answer any questions you may have or engage in any discussions you want to bring up about the project.

Our usual routine is to go through any new issues that have been opened since the last meeting (triage) then have a quick round-the-horn discussion of the team's daily activities.

Newcomers are very welcome, if you have any questions don't hesitate to join.
