# Schedule

## Application

Applications to the Confidential Computing Fellowship are open on a rolling basis. For some initiatives like Outreachy and Google Summer of Code (GSoC), there are well defined deadlines (please check accordingly). We use [LFX Mentorship](https://mentorship.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/project/3dbf9c76-1147-4d49-b4dc-a982061f0b9c) as the platform to manage these applications.

## Contribution

The best way to get accepted into the Confidential Computing Fellowship is to start contributing to the project. A Contributing Guide to the Enarx project is available [here](/docs/Contributing/Introduction). Fellowship opportunities will be awarded to individuals making significant contributions.

## Fellowship/Internship

During the fellowship/internship, each fellow will be paired with one or more mentor(s) who'll work together to define a schedule, depending on the profile (developer, advocate, researcher) and the initiative (Outreachy, Google Summer of Code, etc).

A sample schedule for a 12-week program could be:
- Week 1: Learn about Confidential Computing and the Enarx project;
- Week 2: Learn Rust;
- Week 3: Learn WebAssembly;
- Week 4: Install and run Enarx;
- Week 5: Brainstorm demo ideas;
- Week 6: Develop demos;
- Week 7: Develop demos;
- Week 8: Develop demos;
- Week 9: Build and publish tutorials;
- Week 10: Build and publish tutorials;
- Week 11: Present demo;
- Week 12: Write final report;

## Graduation

Fellows who successfully complete the fellowship program will graduate and receive a Confidential Computing Fellowship certification. Further opportunities will be explored and presented to the fellow based on his/her interests.

## Mentorship

Each fellow who has graduated will be invited to become a mentor of the Confidential Computing Fellowship, helping other individuals like him/her to learn more about Confidential Computing, thus creating a virtuous cycle.
