# RFCs
The Enarx project welcomes contributions!

Would you like to help with the development of Enarx?

This page will guide you towards submiting your first RFC – Request for Comment
–, the process used by the project to formally describe improvements or new
ideas.

There are many different skills needed to build Enarx, from low-level assembly
code for platform-specific enablement (think SGX, SEV, etc.) to kernel-related 
work, from WebAssembly to building and maintaining our infrastracture and automated
integration and testing (CI/CD), and more, so please don't hesitate to try your
hand at any of these or to come and talk to us.

You will find the list of accepted RFCs
[here](https://github.com/enarx/rfcs/blob/main/index.md) and the list of those
open and currently under review [here](https://github.com/enarx/rfcs/pulls).

Most of the explanations for contributing to the Enarx RFC process is described
on the [RFC repo](https://github.com/enarx/rfcs).
