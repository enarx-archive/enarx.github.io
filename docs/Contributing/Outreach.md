# Outreach

Enarx has a strong need for public representation and outreach.

The project has both ambitious goal and a high level of complexity, a combination that requires a lot of outreach.

Here are some of the things we do:
- explain the project
- explain its vision,
- explain its architecture

Here are some of the avenues we use:
- articles
- public speaking at conferences
- exposition hall booths at conferences
- social media

You can have a look at the [outreach issues](https://github.com/enarx/outreach/issues) to find something that needs to be done!

The outreach team meets every other Tuesday at 10:30 EST and Wednesday 10:00 UTC in
the Jitsi Meet room: https://meet.jit.si/EnarxOutreach
