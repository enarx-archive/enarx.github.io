# Docs
The Enarx project welcomes contributions!

This very documentation you are reading takes time and effort to maintain and
improve. Any help here is very welcome.

Here are some ways you can contribute:
- reporting (or even fixing) any broken links you find
- reporting  what you think doesn't make sense
- reporting what you think is missing
- reporting  on how easy or hard it is to find the "right" information (are things organised in a logical way?)

Feel free to click on the `Edit this page` button to fix any problem, open an [issue](https://github.com/enarx/enarx/labels/documentation), or come talk with us over [chat](https://chat.enarx.dev).
