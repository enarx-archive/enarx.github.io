## Issues and Bugs
All our work takes place in the main [enarx/enarx](https://github.com/enarx/enarx) repo.

To keep our work organise, we make heavy use of labels. These allow us to quickly see all issues relating to conferences, infrastructure or WebAssembly, for instance. Here are the labels we use:

- [documentation](https://github.com/enarx/enarx/labels/documentation): Improvements or additions to documentation
- [bug](https://github.com/enarx/enarx/labels/bug): Something isn't working
- [duplicate](https://github.com/enarx/enarx/labels/duplicate): This issue or pull request already exists
- [enhancement](https://github.com/enarx/enarx/labels/enhancement): New feature or request
- [expert help needed](https://github.com/enarx/enarx/labels/expert%20help%20needed):This needs special attention from an area specialist.
- [good first issue](https://github.com/enarx/enarx/labels/good%20first%20issue): Good for newcomers
- [help wanted](https://github.com/enarx/enarx/labels/help%20wanted): Extra attention is needed
- [infrastructure](https://github.com/enarx/enarx/labels/infrastructure): Improvements or additions to project infrastructure
- [invalid](https://github.com/enarx/enarx/labels/invalid): This doesn't seem right

- [tech debt](https://github.com/enarx/enarx/labels/tech-debt): Issues that we recognize create technical debt which will need to be addressed later on. Helps to make this obvious and start planning for it.

- [technology/sgx](https://github.com/enarx/enarx/labels/technology%2Fsgx): All SGX related issues
