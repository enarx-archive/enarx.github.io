# Introduction

WebAssembly also known as WASM (Web Assembly State Machine) is not just a programming language or instruction set, it is also a compilation target for other languages to compile to, as well as a language in itself.

Enarx provides a WebAssembly runtime, based on wasmtime, offering developers a wide range of language choices for implementation, including Rust, C, C++, C#, Go, Java, Python and Haskell.

This guide will show how to implement a Fibonacci example in various languages and run it on Enarx.
