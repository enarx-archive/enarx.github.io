# Introduction

WebAssembly (abbreviated Wasm) is a binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine. Wasm is designed as a portable target for compilation of high-level languages.

Enarx provides a WebAssembly runtime, based on wasmtime, offering developers a wide range of language choices for implementation, including Rust, C, C++, and Go.

This guide will show how to implement a Fibonacci example in various languages and run it on Enarx.
