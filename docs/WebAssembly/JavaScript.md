# WebAssembly with JavaScript

## Environment Setup 

To compile this demo, you must install the following :

### Javy

[Javy](https://github.com/Shopify/javy) is a JavaScript to WebAssembly Toolchain. It is currently used for the 
beta Shopify Scripts Platform.

### msgpack-tools

[msgpack-tools](https://github.com/ludocode/msgpack-tools) contains simple command-line utilities for converting MessagePack to JSON and vice-versa.

### Wasmtime

You will find wasmtime at [wasmtime.dev](https://wasmtime.dev/)

## JavaScript Code Snippet 

We will create a Simple JavaScript Program that will return us the Fibonacci Sequence of an Integer Input.

Create a file named `index.js` or you can name the file whatever you want. In my case, I have named it `index.js`

```JavaScript
//Simple Program to calculate Fibonacci Sequence of an Integer Input
function fibonacci(num){
  var a = 1, b = 0, temp;

  while (num >= 0){
    temp = a;
    a = a + b;
    b = temp;
    num--;
  }
console.log("Fibonacci Term is ",b);
  
}

var Shopify = {
  main: fibonacci
};
```

Now, you might be wondering this is JavaScript Code and fibonacci function is also written in JavaScript as per the syntax but what is the role of this `Shopify` Object here. 

Well the Javy Toolchain expects that our JavaScript code needs to define a global object where `Shopify.main` points to our main function. 
In this case I have defined my main function as `fibonacci`.

### Creating a WASM Binary out of the Source Code
### STEP 1 
Now, in order to create a WASM Binary out of the JavaScript source code, we will need our two weapons in hand `Javy` toolchain and `msgpack-tools` under our belt.

Navigate to `/javy/target/release` directory to generate the WASM Binary using the `./javy` executable.
You will have to save your JavaScript source code in this directory as well.

While installing `javy` you can also install it as a global dependency and then you won't need to navigate to this directory in order to make use of the executable. 
In my case, I haven't installed it globally that's why I have navigated to this directory.

```bash
./javy index.js -o index.wasm
```

After executing this command, you will have the WebAssembly Binary in your directory named `index.wasm`

### STEP 2

After you are done generating the WebAssembly Binary, you will have to create a `JSON` file in this same directory.

The reason you need to create this `JSON` file is because the default implementation of Javy expects a `msgpack` input to be sent through `stdin`

```JSON
10
```

and the reason I have passed `10` as value in JSON is because if we have a look at our Fibonacci Function, it is asking for a parameter `num` in order to calculate our Fibonacci term, and by passing 10 as value it will be substituted in place of the parameter. 

### STEP 3 

Now, since the default implementation expects a `msgpack` input, we will have to convert our `JSON` to a suitable `msgpack` format and we will accomplish this using the `msgpack-tools`.

```bash
json2msgpack -i input.json | wasmtime run index.wasm | msgpack2json
```
If we have a look at this command first of all we pass our `input.json` file as input to `json2msgpack` and then execute it on the top of Wasmtime. 
Also since the message will be `messagepack` encoded, so you will need to decode it with a tool like 
`msgpack2json`.

### STEP 4 : 

Finally you will be able to see your Output displayed and working flawlessly on Wasmtime
