We hope that you will experiment with it to see the progress we \\nare making.\\n\\n# What it Does\\n\\nThis release includes two top-level commands `enarx info` and `enarx run`.\\n\\nThe `enarx info` command dumps information about your hardware platform. It\\n can be useful for determining if your platform has support for one of \\nthe Enarx backends.\\n\\nThe `enarx run` command executes a WASM \\nbinary in a Keep using either the SEV or SGX backends. For testing and \\ndevelopment, you can also run a WASM binary in the unencrypted KVM \\nbackend. Applications are currently limited due to our incomplete \\nsupport for WASI.\\n\\n# Requirements\\n\\n1. A [supported hardware platform](https://github.com/enarx/enarx/wiki/Reproducible-builds-and-Machine-setup)\\n2. Rust nightly\\n\\nFor build instructions, see our [build documentation](https://github.com/enarx/enarx/blob/main/BUILD.md).\\n\\n# Known (Temporary) Issues\\n\\n* Logging is forcibly enabled and outputs to standard error\\n* Incomplete WASI support\\n* All IO is unencrypted\\n* No attestation\\n\\n# SmashEx\\n\\nThis release contains a mitigation for [the SmashEx attack](https://jasonyu1996.github.io/SmashEx/).\\n\\n# Contributors\\n\\nA hearty thanks to everyone who has contributed over the last few years.
