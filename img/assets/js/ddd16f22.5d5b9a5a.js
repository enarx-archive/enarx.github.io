However, when you run containers on a host, the interactions that the container runtime has with the host leak all sorts of information that we really don't want to be making available to it.  One of the design goals of Enarx is to reduce the number of layers that you need to trust, so this isn't a great fit.

Host attestation projects tackle the issue of trust in the host in a different way to Enarx, by measuring the various layers of the stack - typically at boot-up - to check that they are as expected, and have not been substituted for untrusted pieces.  They typically use TPMs (Trusted Platform Modules) as their hardware root of trust.  Enarx aims to remove the need to trust these layers by taking them out of the stack.
