# Enarx website & documentation

This repository contains the assets required to build the [Enarx website and documentation](https://enarx.dev/). We're glad that you want to contribute!

----

## Prerequisites

To install the website locally and build it, you need the following installed:

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

Before you start, install the dependencies. Clone the repository and navigate to the directory:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/enarx/enarx.github.io.git
cd enarx.github.io
```

The Enarx website uses [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) to build a customizable and optimized website.

----

## Running the website

To start a local development server, run the following command: 

```sh
yarn start
```

This starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

----

## Building the website

To build the website, run the following command: 

```sh
yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service. You can run the following command to serve the build:

```sh
yarn serve
```
