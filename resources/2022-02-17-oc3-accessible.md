**Title**: From zero to hero: making Confidential Computing accessible  
**Author**: Nick Vidal  
**Date**: February 17, 2022  

How can we make Confidential Computing accessible, so that developers from all levels can quickly learn and use this technology? In this session, we welcome three Outreachy interns, who had zero knowledge of 
Confidential Computing, to showcase what they've developed in just a few months.
