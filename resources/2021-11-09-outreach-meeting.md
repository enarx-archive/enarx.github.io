## General discussion

### New Enarx.dev Website
Enarx's new website continues evolving. We added a Resources section, where users can filter for different resources: articles, blog posts, events, meetings, podcasts, and releases. The homepage now highlights Docs, Resources, GitHub, Meetings, Events, and Chat. The documentation has been updated and there were various fixes. Next steps include implementing search and developing a better deployment workflow.

### Outreachy
The Enarx project received 10 Outreachy applicants, of which 9 were able to successfully complete the first task this past month. Looking at the work developed by these 9 applicants, we are considering 3 strong candidates for an internship. The WebAssembly tutorials developed by these applicants are available at:
