### Blog
Enarx's Blog is now live and the first drafts are being created. The final URL will be:

## CCC
The TAC has approved Enarx and other CCC projects to be part of the Outreachy program. Besides the benefits of the program itself, another benefit is bringing the CCC projects closer together to collaborate and grow their communities. 

### Outreachy
