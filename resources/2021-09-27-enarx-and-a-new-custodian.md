The Enarx project has a rich history around openness and collaboration. It was a key project in the foundation of the Confidential Computing Consortium from the Linux Foundation and played an important role in the Bytecode Alliance, the nonprofit behind the WebAssembly standard. The Enarx project was born when Mike Bursell and Nathaniel McCallum came together in November 2018 with an idea to build a architecture-neutral framework to run applications within Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs).
