If I’ve managed the process properly, this article should be posting at almost exactly the time that we show a demo at Red Hat Summit 2019 in Boston.  That demo, to be delivered by my colleague Nathaniel McCallum, will be of an early incarnation of Enarx, a project that a few of us at Red Hat have been working on for a few months now, and which we’re ready to start announcing to the world.  We have code, we have a demo, we have a github repository, we have a logo: what more could a project want?  Well, people – but we’ll get to that.
