# Agenda

ConfC2 panel template being worked on (by Aeva).

Showing a cool new demo.

## Confidential Computing Consortium
Motion to allow two companies from the same group of companies (ie: IBM & Red Hat) to join the ConfC2: defeated.
There are still (understandable) concerns that this could lead to undue influence on the board.
However, it also a sign that boards often have too much power over the organisations, even the ConfC2 board is designed to avoid this sort of problem.

### Outreach / Speaker Bureau
A quote was accepted, the idea is now to start building the bureau, with several sub-groups.
Not going with SpeakerHub for now, may do so later.
