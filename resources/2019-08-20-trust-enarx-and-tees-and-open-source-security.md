Today, the Linux Foundation announced the intent to form the Confidential Computing Consortium, a community dedicated to defining and accelerating the adoption of confidential computing. As it so happens, I recorded this podcast at devconf.us last week with Red Hat security experts Mike Bursell and Nathaniel McCallum in which we discuss Red Hat Enarx, a project for providing hardware independence for securing applications using Trusted Execution Environments (TEE). It’s one of the projects that will be contributed to this consortium. We also cover broader issues of trust and open source security.
