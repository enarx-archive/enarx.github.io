We have our first release of Enarx, and a new look for the website. This first release, version 0.1.1, is codenamed Alamo, and provides an easy way in to using Enarx. As always, it’s completely open source: you can look at every single line of our code. It doesn’t provide a full feature set, but what it does do is allow you, for the first time, to write an application, compile it to WebAssembly, and then run it.
