After a brief introduction to Confidential Computing and Enarx, the focus has been on understanding WebAssembly and building the first demos. Applicants developed some examples of running WebAssembly &quot;inside&quot; the browser and &quot;outside.&quot; The reason is because when starting out with WebAssembly, it&#x27;s not obvious that you can have it run standalone. Most examples (in the Internet) in fact target the browser. There are also examples of embedding into other programming languages. Some applicants had to redo their work, so that took some time.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/enarx/outreach/issues/15">https://github.com/enarx/outreach/issues/15</a></p><p><a href="https://www.outreachy.org/">https://www.outreachy.org/</a></p><h2>Events</h2><h3>Cloud Security Alliance</h3><p>Rolling CFP till 2021-December-31.

Nick is coordinating with Ashley and the Linux Foundation to configure DNS for blog.enarx.dev. First post about the New Custodian was published yesterday at:</p><p><a href="https://enarx.ghost.io/">https://enarx.ghost.io/</a></p><h3>Enarx Keeploader</h3><p>As we are getting ready for our first release, Nathaniel has recommended that we give more visibility to <a href="https://github.com/enarx/enarx-keepldr">enarx-keepldr</a>. We also heard feedback from new users who couldn&#x27;t find their way around running enarx just by looking at the current <a href="https://github.com/enarx/enarx">enarx/enarx</a> github repo. That&#x27;s because there is no actual enarx code there, just documentation. So the proposal is to move the enarx/enarx-keepldr code to enarx/enarx, and keep the documentation on enarx/enarx under the wiki. Here&#x27;s a brief action plan:</p><ol><li>Move keepldr code to enarx/enarx (maintains git history)</li><li>Remove docs folder from enarx/enarx, and move it to the wiki</li><li>Move keepldr wiki (2 pages) to enarx/enarx wiki</li><li>Transfer keepldr issues to enarx/enarx</li><li>Transfer enarx/enarx non-code issues to enarx/outreach</li><li>PRs can still get merged across repos (from keepldr to enarx/enarx)</li></ol><h3>Vulnerability Disclosure and Embargo Policy</h3><p>The CCC has again urgently requested that all CCC projects have a disclosure policy. I sent a PR to adopt the Vulnerability Disclosure and Embargo Policy proposed by axel:</p><p><a href="https://github.com/enarx/rfcs/tree/master/00002-vulnerability-disclosure-and-embargo-policy">https://github.com/enarx/rfcs/tree/master/00002-vulnerability-disclosure-and-embargo-policy</a></p><h2>CCC</h2><p>The TAC has approved Enarx and other CCC projects to be part of the Outreachy program. Besides the benefits of the program itself, another benefit is bringing the CCC projects closer together to collaborate and grow their communities. </p><h3>Outreachy</h3><p>The Outreachy community application deadline was extended to October 6. Nick and Ashley already filled out the application.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/enarx/outreach/issues/15">https://github.com/enarx/outreach/issues/15</a></p><p><a href="https://www.outreachy.org/">https://www.outreachy.org/</a></p><h3>Hacktoberfest</h3><p>Hacktoberfest&#x27;s website is now live.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As an emerging technique for confidential computing, trusted execution environment (TEE) receives a lot of attention. To better develop, deploy, and run secure applications on a TEE platform such as Intel's SGX, both academic and industrial teams have devoted much effort to developing reliable and convenient TEE containers. In this paper, we studied the isolation strategies of 15 existing TEE containers to protect secure applications from potentially malicious operating systems (OS) or untrusted applications, using a semi-automatic approach combining a feedback-guided analyzer with manual code review. Our analysis reveals the isolation protection each of these TEE containers enforces, and their security weaknesses.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As an emerging technique for confidential computing, trusted execution environment (TEE) receives a lot of attention. To better develop, deploy, and run secure applications on a TEE platform such as Intel&#x27;s SGX, both academic and industrial teams have devoted much effort to developing reliable and convenient TEE containers. In this paper, we studied the isolation strategies of 15 existing TEE containers to protect secure applications from potentially malicious operating systems (OS) or untrusted applications, using a semi-automatic approach combining a feedback-guided analyzer with manual code review. Our analysis reveals the isolation protection each of these TEE containers enforces, and their security weaknesses.

<a href="https://meet.jit.si/EnarxOutreach">https://meet.jit.si/EnarxOutreach</a></p><h3>Blog</h3><p>We&#x27;ll likely be using <a href="https://ghost.org/features/">Ghost</a> as the blogging platform for Enarx. It&#x27;s open source, based on Node.js, and has managed hosting. We also looked into WordPress - which is the &quot;standard - but one key advantage of Ghost is that it provides native support for email newsletters. It manages members and subscriptions and allows you to segment the user base. Other advantages of Ghost include: a) native markdown support, b) a more minimalist approach, and c) a more modern architecture. It also provides webhooks and a REST API for integrations. By the next meeting, we should have the Enarx Blog up and running.</p><h2>CCC</h2><p>Ashley and Ben both added the Outreachy proposal to the agenda of the CCC Outreach and TAC meetings. The TAC will make a decision by September 9 (TAC&#x27;s next meeting). The Outreachy community application deadline is September 10.</p><h3>Outreachy</h3><p>Nick and Shaun agreed that we should have the Outreachy application ready for both cases, where CCC supports us, or where we apply on our own as Enarx.
<a href="https://github.com/enarx/outreach/issues/15">https://github.com/enarx/outreach/issues/15</a></p><h3>Hacktoberfest</h3><p>We should start planning for Hacktoberfest, with a focus on building simple demos to demonstrate Enarx. Nick will work with Will next week to get this going:
<a href="https://github.com/enarx/outreach/issues/14">https://github.com/enarx/outreach/issues/14</a></p><h2>Events</h2><h3>Enigma / Usenix</h3><p>Proposal sent to Enigma successfully:
<a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/enigma2021/call-for-participation">https://www.usenix.org/conference/enigma2021/call-for-participation</a></p><h3>Cloud Security Alliance</h3><p>Rolling CFP till 2021-December-31. Let&#x27;s create a proposal in October/November.
<a href="https://www.cvent.com/c/abstracts/6e04faab-fd38-4df4-b2a3-2e2780b7c24b">https://www.cvent.com/c/abstracts/6e04faab-fd38-4df4-b2a3-2e2780b7c24b</a></p><h3>Enarx Sticker Design</h3><p>Added Enarx sticker design to the image assets. Who&#x27;s traveling to Open Source Summit? Given COVID and the Delta variant, we don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ll make it. Should we send stickers to people anyways? To whom? Perhaps a marketing campaign to go along with the CCC Survey Report.

ConfC2 panel template being worked on (by Aeva).</p><h4>DevConf US</h4><p>24/25th Sept, tech crowd
Showing a cool new demo.</p><h2>Confidential Computing Consortium</h2><p>Motion to allow two companies from the same group of companies (ie: IBM &amp; Red Hat) to join the ConfC2: defeated.
There are still (understandable) concerns that this could lead to undue influence on the board.
However, it also a sign that boards often have too much power over the organisations, even the ConfC2 board is designed to avoid this sort of problem.</p><h3>Outreach / Speaker Bureau</h3><p>A quote was accepted, the idea is now to start building the bureau, with several sub-groups.
Not going with SpeakerHub for now, may do so later.</p>]]></content>

AMD SEV can encrypt the memory and register state of VMs individually, isolating them from the hypervisor.  Enarx is an open source project led by Red Hat, leveraging TEEs, and providing attestation and protection for run-time workloads. It is written in Rust and aims to reduce the number of trust relationships required when running executables in the private or public cloud.
