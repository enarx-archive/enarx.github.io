Over at Enarx, we’re preparing for another release. They’re coming every four weeks now, and we’re getting into a good rhythm. Thanks to all contributors, and also those working on streamlining the release process. It’s a complex project with lots of dependencies – some internal, and some external – and we’re still feeling our way about how best to manage it all. One thing that you will be starting to see in our documentation, and which we intend to formalise in coming releases, is support for particular languages. I don’t mean human languages (though translations of Enarx documentation into different languages, to support as diverse a community as we can, is definitely of interest), but programming languages.
