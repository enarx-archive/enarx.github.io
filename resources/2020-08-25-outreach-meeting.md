# Agenda

## OSS events
### Public communication channel
We don't need our own Slack subscription, we can use the LF-provided one for OSS Europe.

## Confidential C2
### Speaker Bureau
Ben getting quote from Speakerhub.
Good thing is people actually look for speakers on Speakerhub.

**Action**: create a Speakerhub (free), mention "confidential computing" in your profile.

Ben's proposal: let's start building a simple page (like LF Edge has).
Start with leadership team, then go through communities.

### New outreach whitepaper
Will be released very soon.

### Website
Pages are being updated one at a time.
Improve SEO by looking at analytics data.

## Enarx short stories
LinkedIn etc.  
Aim: Consistent, concerted voice. Work together with Twitter feed and website.

What focus?  
Recruitment? Spotlight on website? Technical aspect?  
Up until now, the goal has been to improve understanding of the core problem & encourage people to join the community.
* (Recruitment) Present relatable human element of project to target audience on this social media platform. Team
member interviews similar to RH Summit?
* (Website spotlight) Link to appropriate landing page(s) to direct traffic.
* (Technical highlights) Coordinate with team to highlight interesting aspects of project.

Possible format:
"3 questions withâ€¦"

## Formal representation
- LinkedIn organisation (profile you can follow, adds credibility on platform)

Idea: have more ways to amplify the message
