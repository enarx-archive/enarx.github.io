# Agenda
## Events
#### RSA conference
Mike has answered: two talks, one Enarx-based.

#### DevConf US
Hopin.to so much better than things we've used before.
Problem: people a bit bored of online conferences. Last slot in the day, so only US-based folks saw the talk.
Good video, now published on YT.
All in all, went rather well.

#### Future conferences
Ask to have polls asked on our behalf? ("Do you know Confidential Computing?")

#### OSS Europe (Dublin, 26 October)
No access to platform yet. Should have time to prepare.
Timeslots not confirmed yet, will sign-up volunteers once we have them.

List of topics.
