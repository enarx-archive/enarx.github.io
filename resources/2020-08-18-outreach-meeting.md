# Agenda

## Open Source Summit
Slack channel considered useful, looking for a long-lived channel for conferences: using the LF-provided chat going forward.

## Extra channel for the project
Linkedin: simple blog posts (~200W)  
Twitter being used more, including on the Confidential C2

## Direct Outreach

### Confidential C2 Speaker Bureau
Ben working on a proposal, possibly using SpeakerHub.  
Ideally 2 sections: more technical and more business

### Red Hat
Getting better at telling a story around Enarx.  
Work needed on Analyst Relations.
