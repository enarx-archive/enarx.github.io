## Agenda
### Next outreach target

We need to start a conversation, most likely on the [chat](https://chat.enarx.io) at least for a start, regarding what we want to target next that would make sense in terms of outreach.
At the last meeting, we mentioned the idea of an attack that would succeed without Enarx by fail when run against a workload in an Enarx Keep. However, we want to ensure we demonstrate useful features and code, rather than code just for a demo.
