Traditionally, when you run a workload in a VM, container or in a serverless environment, that workload is vulnerable to interference by any person or software with hypervisor, root or kernel access. That turns out to be quite a few people one has little choice but to trust, both in the cloud, of course, but also on oneâ€™s own hardware. The Enarx project aims to mitigate this by leveraging the hardware-based security properties offered by the Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) found on recent CPUs. Enarx will make it simple to deploy workloads to a variety of TEEs in the public cloud, making it possible to deploy confidential workloads to third party servers without needing to relinquish trust to those who operate them.
