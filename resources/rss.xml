            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a previous blog post, we outlined our vision for creating a Confidential Computing Fellowship. Today, we announce the first steps towards this vision, as we welcome three new interns to the Enarx project.</p><p>Last month, we received 10 Outreachy applicants. Of these, 9 were able to complete the first task successfully, which consisted of learning about WebAssembly, developing some small demos, and publishing one or more tutorials on GitHub. WebAssembly is key to the Enarx project, as this is how we deploy applications to the Cloud.</p><p><strong>Source</strong>: Enarx&#x27;s Blog</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="https://blog.enarx.dev/welcome-outreachy-interns/">https://blog.enarx.dev/welcome-outreachy-interns/</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

After a brief introduction to Confidential Computing and Enarx, the focus has been on understanding WebAssembly and building the first demos. Applicants developed some examples of running WebAssembly &quot;inside&quot; the browser and &quot;outside.&quot; The reason is because when starting out with WebAssembly, it&#x27;s not obvious that you can have it run standalone. Most examples (in the Internet) in fact target the browser. There are also examples of embedding into other programming languages. Some applicants had to redo their work, so that took some time.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/enarx/outreach/issues/15">https://github.com/enarx/outreach/issues/15</a></p><p><a href="https://www.outreachy.org/">https://www.outreachy.org/</a></p><h2>Events</h2><h3>Cloud Security Alliance</h3><p>Rolling CFP till 2021-December-31.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<ul><li>axel</li><li>Ben</li><li>Mike </li><li>Nick</li><li>Shaun</li></ul><h1>Agenda</h1><h2>General discussion</h2><h3>Blog</h3><p>Enarx&#x27;s Blog is now live. Nick is coordinating with Ashley and the Linux Foundation to configure DNS for blog.enarx.dev. First post about the New Custodian was published yesterday at:</p><p><a href="https://enarx.ghost.io/">https://enarx.ghost.io/</a></p><h3>Enarx Keeploader</h3><p>As we are getting ready for our first release, Nathaniel has recommended that we give more visibility to <a href="https://github.com/enarx/enarx-keepldr">enarx-keepldr</a>. We also heard feedback from new users who couldn&#x27;t find their way around running enarx just by looking at the current <a href="https://github.com/enarx/enarx">enarx/enarx</a> github repo. That&#x27;s because there is no actual enarx code there, just documentation. So the proposal is to move the enarx/enarx-keepldr code to enarx/enarx, and keep the documentation on enarx/enarx under the wiki. Here&#x27;s a brief action plan:</p><ol><li>Move keepldr code to enarx/enarx (maintains git history)</li><li>Remove docs folder from enarx/enarx, and move it to the wiki</li><li>Move keepldr wiki (2 pages) to enarx/enarx wiki</li><li>Transfer keepldr issues to enarx/enarx</li><li>Transfer enarx/enarx non-code issues to enarx/outreach</li><li>PRs can still get merged across repos (from keepldr to enarx/enarx)</li></ol><h3>Vulnerability Disclosure and Embargo Policy</h3><p>The CCC has again urgently requested that all CCC projects have a disclosure policy. I sent a PR to adopt the Vulnerability Disclosure and Embargo Policy proposed by axel:</p><p><a href="https://github.com/enarx/rfcs/tree/master/00002-vulnerability-disclosure-and-embargo-policy">https://github.com/enarx/rfcs/tree/master/00002-vulnerability-disclosure-and-embargo-policy</a></p><h2>CCC</h2><p>The TAC has approved Enarx and other CCC projects to be part of the Outreachy program. Besides the benefits of the program itself, another benefit is bringing the CCC projects closer together to collaborate and grow their communities. </p><h3>Outreachy</h3><p>The Outreachy community application deadline was extended to October 6. Nick and Ashley already filled out the application.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/enarx/outreach/issues/15">https://github.com/enarx/outreach/issues/15</a></p><p><a href="https://www.outreachy.org/">https://www.outreachy.org/</a></p><h3>Hacktoberfest</h3><p>Hacktoberfest&#x27;s website is now live.

            <description><![CDATA[As an emerging technique for confidential computing, trusted execution environment (TEE) receives a lot of attention. To better develop, deploy, and run secure applications on a TEE platform such as Intel's SGX, both academic and industrial teams have devoted much effort to developing reliable and convenient TEE containers. In this paper, we studied the isolation strategies of 15 existing TEE containers to protect secure applications from potentially malicious operating systems (OS) or untrusted applications, using a semi-automatic approach combining a feedback-guided analyzer with manual code review. Our analysis reveals the isolation protection each of these TEE containers enforces, and their security weaknesses. We observe that none of the existing TEE containers can fulfill the goal they set, due to various pitfalls in their design and implementation. We report the lessons learnt from our study for guiding the development of more secure containers, and further discuss thetrend of TEE container designs. We also release our analyzer that helps evaluate the container middleware both from the enclave and from the kernel.]]></description>

<a href="https://meet.jit.si/EnarxOutreach">https://meet.jit.si/EnarxOutreach</a></p><h3>Blog</h3><p>We&#x27;ll likely be using <a href="https://ghost.org/features/">Ghost</a> as the blogging platform for Enarx. It&#x27;s open source, based on Node.js, and has managed hosting. We also looked into WordPress - which is the &quot;standard - but one key advantage of Ghost is that it provides native support for email newsletters. It manages members and subscriptions and allows you to segment the user base. Other advantages of Ghost include: a) native markdown support, b) a more minimalist approach, and c) a more modern architecture. It also provides webhooks and a REST API for integrations. By the next meeting, we should have the Enarx Blog up and running.</p><h2>CCC</h2><p>Ashley and Ben both added the Outreachy proposal to the agenda of the CCC Outreach and TAC meetings. The TAC will make a decision by September 9 (TAC&#x27;s next meeting). The Outreachy community application deadline is September 10.</p><h3>Outreachy</h3><p>Nick and Shaun agreed that we should have the Outreachy application ready for both cases, where CCC supports us, or where we apply on our own as Enarx.
<a href="https://github.com/enarx/outreach/issues/15">https://github.com/enarx/outreach/issues/15</a></p><h3>Hacktoberfest</h3><p>We should start planning for Hacktoberfest, with a focus on building simple demos to demonstrate Enarx. Nick will work with Will next week to get this going:

Who&#x27;s traveling to Open Source Summit? Given COVID and the Delta variant, we don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ll make it. Should we send stickers to people anyways? To whom? Perhaps a marketing campaign to go along with the CCC Survey Report.

There are still (understandable) concerns that this could lead to undue influence on the board.

At the last meeting, we mentioned the idea of an attack that would succeed without Enarx by fail when run against a workload in an Enarx Keep. However, we want to ensure we demonstrate useful features and code, rather than code just for a demo.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[Yesterday, Nathaniel McCallum and I presented a session “Confidential Computing and Enarx” at Open Source Summit Europe. As well as some new information on the architectural components for an Enarx deployment, we had a new demo. What’s exciting about this demo was that it shows off attestation and encryption on Intel’s SGX. Our initial work focussed on AMD’s SEV, so this is our first working multi-platform work flow. We’re very excited, and particularly as this week a number of the team will be attending the first face to face meetings of the Confidential Computing Consortium, at which we’ll be submitting Enarx as a project for contribution to the Consortium.]]></description>

AMD SEV (Secure Encrypted Virtualization) is a new CPU security technology available in AMD's EPYC processors and provides new levels of protection for virtualized workloads. AMD SEV can encrypt the memory and register state of VMs individually, isolating them from the hypervisor.  Enarx is an open source project led by Red Hat, leveraging TEEs, and providing attestation and protection for run-time workloads. It is written in Rust and aims to reduce the number of trust relationships required when running executables in the private or public cloud. It currently supports AMD SEV, and this session will: a) Discuss SEV capabilities and roadmap; b) Introduce the Enarx architecture; c) Present some of the components of Enarx; d) Show a demonstration of an early set of Enarx capabilities.]]></description>
