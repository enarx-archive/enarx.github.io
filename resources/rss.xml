            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Title</strong>: Logging, debugging and error management in Confidential Computing<br>
<strong>Author</strong>: Mike Bursell<br>
<strong>Date</strong>: Saturday, February 5, 2022, 13:25 AM - 13:50  </p><p>Debugging applications is an important part of the development process. However, error messages and general logging can leak sensitive data, and in some cases even compromise your whole stack, as developers worldwide have recently learned from the log4j vulnerability.</p><p>With Conﬁdential Computing, the world gets much more complicated, as every piece of information that a malicious entity on the host (including the host itself!) can gather may be leaking vital information about your workload. This talk details some of the problems that arise, and discusses some options to address them whilst considering real life workloads and application lifecycles.</p><p><em>Full Abstract</em></p><p>Log entries and other error messages can be very useful, but they can also provide information to other parties - sometimes information which you’d prefer they didn’t have. This is particularly true when you are thinking about Confidential Computing: running applications or workloads in environments where you really want to protect the confidentiality and integrity of your application and its data.</p><p>This talk examines some of the issues that we need to consider when designing Confidential Computing frameworks, the applications we run in them, and their operations. Designers and architects of the TEE infrastructure and even, to a lesser extent, of potential workloads themselves, need to consider very carefully the impact of host gaining access to messages associated with the workload and the infrastructure components. It is, realistically, infeasible to restrict all communication to levels appropriate for deployment, so it is recommended that various profiles are created which can be applied to different stages of a deployment, and whose use is carefully monitored, logged (!) and controlled by process.</p><p><strong>Source</strong>: FOSDEM 2022</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="https://fosdem.org/2022/schedule/track/hardware_aided_trusted_computing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://fosdem.org/2022/schedule/track/hardware_aided_trusted_computing/</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<strong>Author</strong>: Nick Vidal<br>
<strong>Date</strong>: Saturday, February 5, 2022, 10:55 AM - 11:20 AM  </p><p>The Enarx project reached a huge milestone: its first official release, featuring WebAssembly runtime. WebAssembly and Confidential Computing are a great match because WebAssembly offers developers a wide range of language choices, it works across silicon architectures, and it provides a sandboxed environment. This presentation will highlight the benefits of WebAssembly to Confidential Computing and showcase some demos.</p><p><em>Full Abstract</em></p><p>After 3 years since its inception, the Enarx project finally had its first official release, bringing WebAssembly to Confidential Computing.</p><p>Enarx is a deployment framework for running applications in TEE instances – which we refer to as “Keeps” – without the need to trust lots of dependencies, without the need to rewrite the application, and without the need to implement attestation separately.</p><p>The WebAssembly runtime, based on wasmtime, offers developers a wide range of language choices for implementation, including Rust, C, and C++. It is designed to work across silicon architectures transparently to the user so that the application can run equally simple on Intel platforms (SGX or the recently-announced TDX), AMD platforms (SEV) or forthcoming platforms such as Arms’ Realms and IBM’s PEF - all without having to recompile the application code. WebAssembly's sandbox model offers an extra layer of protection, isolating the application from the host.</p><p><strong>Source</strong>: FOSDEM 2022</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="https://fosdem.org/2022/schedule/track/hardware_aided_trusted_computing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://fosdem.org/2022/schedule/track/hardware_aided_trusted_computing/</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Trust in Computer Systems and the Cloud delivers an insightful and practical new take on what it means to trust in the context of computer and network security and the impact on the emerging field of Confidential Computing. Author Mike Bursell’s experience, ranging from Chief Security Architect at Red Hat to CEO at a Confidential Computing start-up grounds the reader in fundamental concepts of trust and related ideas before discussing the more sophisticated applications of these concepts to various areas in computing. </p><p>The book demonstrates in the importance of understanding and quantifying risk and draws on the social and computer sciences to explain hardware and software security, complex systems, and open source communities. It takes a detailed look at the impact of Confidential Computing on security, trust and risk and also describes the emerging concept of trust domains, which provide an alternative to standard layered security. </p><p><strong>Source</strong>: Wiley</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="https://www.wiley.com/en-gb/Trust+in+Computer+Systems+and+the+Cloud-p-9781119692324" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.wiley.com/en-gb/Trust+in+Computer+Systems+and+the+Cloud-p-9781119692324</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<strong>Author</strong>: Mike Bursell<br>
<strong>Date</strong>: Tuesday, December 7, 2021, 11:00 AM - 11:45 AM  </p><p>The Cloud is just somebody else’s computer. So when you run a workload on a
cloud host, anyone who owns (or pwns) that system can look into it or
change the data or event the application itself. You have no
confidentiality or integrity protection from your Cloud Service
Provider, rogue sysadmins or just anyone who compromises their machines.
Confidential computing uses hardware-based trusted execution
environment (e.g. Intel SGX, AMD SEV or Arm 9 Realms) to provide these
protections, but it’s difficult to use and complex to understand.</p><p>This session will introduce the problem at a technical level, explain
some of the solutions, and discuss why confidential computing is on its
way – but not an easy fix (yet). Come and be amused, horrified, and
excited; all in one presentation.</p><p><strong>Source</strong>: SecurityWeekly Unlocked 2021</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="https://events.securityweekly.com/unlocked2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://events.securityweekly.com/unlocked2021</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

After a brief introduction to Confidential Computing and Enarx, the focus has been on understanding WebAssembly and building the first demos. Applicants developed some examples of running WebAssembly "inside" the browser and "outside." The reason is because when starting out with WebAssembly, it's not obvious that you can have it run standalone. Most examples (in the Internet) in fact target the browser. There are also examples of embedding into other programming languages. Some applicants had to redo their work, so that took some time.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/enarx/outreach/issues/15" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/enarx/outreach/issues/15</a></p><p><a href="https://www.outreachy.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.outreachy.org/</a></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="events">Events<a class="hash-link" href="#events" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="cloud-security-alliance">Cloud Security Alliance<a class="hash-link" href="#cloud-security-alliance" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Rolling CFP till 2021-December-31.

We also heard feedback from new users who couldn't find their way around running enarx just by looking at the current <a href="https://github.com/enarx/enarx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">enarx/enarx</a> github repo. That's because there is no actual enarx code there, just documentation. So the proposal is to move the enarx/enarx-keepldr code to enarx/enarx, and keep the documentation on enarx/enarx under the wiki. Here's a brief action plan:</p><ol><li>Move keepldr code to enarx/enarx (maintains git history)</li><li>Remove docs folder from enarx/enarx, and move it to the wiki</li><li>Move keepldr wiki (2 pages) to enarx/enarx wiki</li><li>Transfer keepldr issues to enarx/enarx</li><li>Transfer enarx/enarx non-code issues to enarx/outreach</li><li>PRs can still get merged across repos (from keepldr to enarx/enarx)</li></ol><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="vulnerability-disclosure-and-embargo-policy">Vulnerability Disclosure and Embargo Policy<a class="hash-link" href="#vulnerability-disclosure-and-embargo-policy" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>The CCC has again urgently requested that all CCC projects have a disclosure policy.

            <description><![CDATA[As an emerging technique for confidential computing, trusted execution environment (TEE) receives a lot of attention. To better develop, deploy, and run secure applications on a TEE platform such as Intel's SGX, both academic and industrial teams have devoted much effort to developing reliable and convenient TEE containers. In this paper, we studied the isolation strategies of 15 existing TEE containers to protect secure applications from potentially malicious operating systems (OS) or untrusted applications, using a semi-automatic approach combining a feedback-guided analyzer with manual code review. Our analysis reveals the isolation protection each of these TEE containers enforces, and their security weaknesses. We observe that none of the existing TEE containers can fulfill the goal they set, due to various pitfalls in their design and implementation. We report the lessons learnt from our study for guiding the development of more secure containers, and further discuss thetrend of TEE container designs. We also release our analyzer that helps evaluate the container middleware both from the enclave and from the kernel.]]></description>

It's open source, based on Node.js, and has managed hosting. We also looked into WordPress - which is the "standard - but one key advantage of Ghost is that it provides native support for email newsletters. It manages members and subscriptions and allows you to segment the user base. Other advantages of Ghost include: a) native markdown support, b) a more minimalist approach, and c) a more modern architecture. It also provides webhooks and a REST API for integrations. By the next meeting, we should have the Enarx Blog up and running.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="ccc">CCC<a class="hash-link" href="#ccc" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Ashley and Ben both added the Outreachy proposal to the agenda of the CCC Outreach and TAC meetings.

The Enarx project aims to mitigate this by leveraging the hardware-based security properties offered by the Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) found on recent CPUs.

            <description><![CDATA[Many CISOs, CSOs, and CIOs continue to struggle to protect data from sophisticated cross-cloud orchestration and cross-tenant attacks, among others. It’s a modern variation of a familiar challenge: balancing security and privacy with usability. While placing and processing intellectual property on shared servers is fraught, experts say the risk can and must be managed. That’s the aim of a new cross-industry effort, the Confidential Computing Consortium. Founded in 2019, the collaboration operates within The Linux Foundation. Its mission is defining and promoting adoption of confidential computing, which protects sensitive data within system memory, a new favored target for attackers. Backers include industry heavyweights Alibaba, ARM, Baidu, Google Cloud, IBM, Intel, Microsoft, Red Hat, and Tencent.]]></description>

That’s the aim of a new cross-industry effort, the Confidential Computing Consortium. Founded in 2019, the collaboration operates within The Linux Foundation. Its mission is defining and promoting adoption of confidential computing, which protects sensitive data within system memory, a new favored target for attackers. Backers include industry heavyweights Alibaba, ARM, Baidu, Google Cloud, IBM, Intel, Microsoft, Red Hat, and Tencent.</p><p><strong>Source</strong>: VentureBeat</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2019/12/31/protecting-public-cloud-and-edge-data-with-confidential-computing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://venturebeat.com/2019/12/31/protecting-public-cloud-and-edge-data-with-confidential-computing/</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

As well as some new information on the architectural components for an Enarx deployment, we had a new demo. What’s exciting about this demo was that it shows off attestation and encryption on Intel’s SGX. Our initial work focussed on AMD’s SEV, so this is our first working multi-platform work flow. We’re very excited, and particularly as this week a number of the team will be attending the first face to face meetings of the Confidential Computing Consortium, at which we’ll be submitting Enarx as a project for contribution to the Consortium.]]></description>
