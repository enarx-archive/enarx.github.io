If you run software on someone’s servers, you have a problem. You can’t be sure your data and code aren’t being observed, or worse, tampered with — trust is your only assurance. But there is hope, in the form of Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) and a new open source project, Enarx, that will make use of TEEs to minimize the trust you need to confidently run on other people’s hardware. This article delves into this problem, how TEE’s work and their limitations, providing a TEE primer of sorts, and explaining how Enarx aims to work around these limitations. It is the next in a series that started with Trust No One, Run Everywhere–Introducing Enarx.
