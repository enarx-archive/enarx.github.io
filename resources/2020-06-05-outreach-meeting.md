## Present
- Ben F
- Mike D
- Shaun M

## Agenda

- Next outreach target: must start conversation
- Linux Foundation Open Source Summit North America
  - Confidential Computing Consortium will have a booth
    - Focus on awareness? Projects? Both?
- Ben: What is the right level at which to pitch information?
  - Mike: liked the slides that broke things down to an understandable level. Also, often people are looking for value, more than technical understanding: how can it resolve their issues.
  - So four things:
     - Videos (such as the Red Hat Summit 2020 interviews)
     - Presentations ([slides](https://github.com/enarx/enarx.github.io/blob/master/docs/enarx_slides_2020-02.pdf))
     - Technical brief (~2 pages)
     - Business brief (same thing, but with a product marketing hat on: what does encryption mean to companies)
