In a previous blog post, we outlined our vision for creating a Confidential Computing Fellowship. Today, we announce the first steps towards this vision, as we welcome three new interns to the Enarx project.

Last month, we received 10 Outreachy applicants. Of these, 9 were able to complete the first task successfully, which consisted of learning about WebAssembly, developing some small demos, and publishing one or more tutorials on GitHub. WebAssembly is key to the Enarx project, as this is how we deploy applications to the Cloud.
