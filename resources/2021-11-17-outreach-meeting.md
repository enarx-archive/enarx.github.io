# Agenda

## General discussion

### Outreachy
The Outreachy applicants had the opportunity to share with others their experience so far with the Enarx project: what they learned and what challenges they faced.

Results for the Outreachy program will be published next Monday (22nd), but Nick reassured everyone that, independent of the results, he would like to continue working with them.

A new group of WebAssembly enthusiasts is being formed at [wasm.builders](https://www.wasm.builders/) and Nick suggested for each one to publish their WebAssembly tutorials there for visibility. This will help them to build their portfolio and will open new opportunities.
