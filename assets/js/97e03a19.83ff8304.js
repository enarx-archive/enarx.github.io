However, error messages and general logging can leak sensitive data, and in some cases even compromise your whole stack, as developers worldwide have recently learned from the log4j vulnerability.\\n\\nWith Con\ufb01dential Computing, the world gets much more complicated, as every piece of information that a malicious entity on the host (including the host itself!) can gather may be leaking vital information about your workload. This talk details some of the problems that arise, and discusses some options to address them whilst considering real life workloads and application lifecycles.\\n\\n_Full Abstract_\\n\\nLog entries and other error messages can be very useful, but they can also provide information to other parties - sometimes information which you\u2019d prefer they didn\u2019t have. This is particularly true when you are thinking about Confidential Computing: running applications or workloads in environments where you really want to protect the confidentiality and integrity of your application and its data.\\n\\nThis talk examines some of the issues that we need to consider when designing Confidential Computing frameworks, the applications we run in them, and their operations. Designers and architects of the TEE infrastructure and even, to a lesser extent, of potential workloads themselves, need to consider very carefully the impact of host gaining access to messages associated with the workload and the infrastructure components. It is, realistically, infeasible to restrict all communication to levels appropriate for deployment, so it is recommended that various profiles are created which can be applied to different stages of a deployment, and whose use is carefully monitored, logged (!) and controlled by process.\\n\\n**Source**: FOSDEM 2022\\n\\n**Link**: https://fosdem.org/2022/schedule/track/hardware_aided_trusted_computing/"},{"id":"2022-02-05-fosdem-wasm-cc","metadata":{"permalink":"/resources/2022-02-05-fosdem-wasm-cc","source":"@site/resources/2022-02-05-fosdem-wasm-cc.md","title":"WebAssembly + Confidential Computing","description":"Title: WebAssembly + Confidential Computing","date":"2022-02-05T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"February 5, 2022","tags":[{"label":"Event","permalink":"/resources/tags/event"},{"label":"Webinar","permalink":"/resources/tags/webinar"}],"truncated":false,"authors":[{"name":"Nick Vidal","title":"Community Manager","url":"https://github.com/nickvidal","imageURL":"https://github.com/nickvidal.png","key":"nick"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"2022-02-05-fosdem-wasm-cc","title":"WebAssembly + Confidential Computing","authors":["nick"],"tags":["Event","Webinar"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Logging, debugging and error management in Confidential Computing","permalink":"/resources/2022-02-05-fosdem-logging"},"nextItem":{"title":"2022-01-19 Community Meeting","permalink":"/resources/2022/01/19/community-meeting"}},"content":"**Title**: WebAssembly + Confidential Computing  \\n**Author**: Nick Vidal  \\n**Date**: Saturday, February 5, 2022, 10:55 AM - 11:20 AM  \\n\\nThe Enarx project reached a huge milestone: its first official release, featuring WebAssembly runtime. WebAssembly and Confidential Computing are a great match because WebAssembly offers developers a wide range of language choices, it works across silicon architectures, and it provides a sandboxed environment. This presentation will highlight the benefits of WebAssembly to Confidential Computing and showcase some demos.\\n\\n_Full Abstract_\\n\\nAfter 3 years since its inception, the Enarx project finally had its first official release, bringing WebAssembly to Confidential Computing.\\n\\nEnarx is a deployment framework for running applications in TEE instances \u2013 which we refer to as \u201cKeeps\u201d \u2013 without the need to trust lots of dependencies, without the need to rewrite the application, and without the need to implement attestation separately.\\n\\nThe WebAssembly runtime, based on wasmtime, offers developers a wide range of language choices for implementation, including Rust, C, and C++. It is designed to work across silicon architectures transparently to the user so that the application can run equally simple on Intel platforms (SGX or the recently-announced TDX), AMD platforms (SEV) or forthcoming platforms such as Arms\u2019 Realms and IBM\u2019s PEF - all without having to recompile the application code. WebAssembly\'s sandbox model offers an extra layer of protection, isolating the application from the host.\\n\\n**Source**: FOSDEM 2022\\n\\n**Link**: https://fosdem.org/2022/schedule/track/hardware_aided_trusted_computing/"},{"id":"/2022/01/19/community-meeting","metadata":{"permalink":"/resources/2022/01/19/community-meeting","source":"@site/resources/2022-01-19-community-meeting.md","title":"2022-01-19 Community Meeting","description":"* Ben","date":"2022-01-19T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"January 19, 2022","tags":[{"label":"Meeting","permalink":"/resources/tags/meeting"}],"truncated":false,"authors":[{"name":"Enarx","imageURL":"https://github.com/enarxbot.png","key":"enarx"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"2022-01-19 Community Meeting","authors":["enarx"],"tags":["Meeting"]},"prevItem":{"title":"WebAssembly + Confidential Computing","permalink":"/resources/2022-02-05-fosdem-wasm-cc"},"nextItem":{"title":"2022-01-12 Community Meeting","permalink":"/resources/2022/01/12/community-meeting"}},"content":"* Ben\\n* Jarkko\\n* Mike\\n* Nick\\n* Paul\\n\\n# Agenda\\n\\n## Upcoming Events\\n\\n- 2022-02-05: [FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org/2022/) (2 talks approved)\\n  -

Nick is coordinating with Ashley and the Linux Foundation to configure DNS for blog.enarx.dev. First post about the New Custodian was published yesterday at:\\n\\nhttps://enarx.ghost.io/\\n\\n### Enarx Keeploader\\n\\nAs we are getting ready for our first release, Nathaniel has recommended that we give more visibility to [enarx-keepldr](https://github.com/enarx/enarx-keepldr). We also heard feedback from new users who couldn\'t find their way around running enarx just by looking at the current [enarx/enarx](https://github.com/enarx/enarx) github repo. That\'s because there is no actual enarx code there, just documentation. So the proposal is to move the enarx/enarx-keepldr code to enarx/enarx, and keep the documentation on enarx/enarx under the wiki. Here\'s a brief action plan:\\n1. Move keepldr code to enarx/enarx (maintains git history)\\n1. Remove docs folder from enarx/enarx, and move it to the wiki\\n1. Move keepldr wiki (2 pages) to enarx/enarx wiki\\n1. Transfer keepldr issues to enarx/enarx\\n1. Transfer enarx/enarx non-code issues to enarx/outreach\\n1. PRs can still get merged across repos (from keepldr to enarx/enarx)\\n\\n### Vulnerability Disclosure and Embargo Policy\\n\\nThe CCC has again urgently requested that all CCC projects have a disclosure policy. I sent a PR to adopt the Vulnerability Disclosure and Embargo Policy proposed by axel:\\n\\nhttps://github.com/enarx/rfcs/tree/master/00002-vulnerability-disclosure-and-embargo-policy\\n\\n\\n## CCC\\nThe TAC has approved Enarx and other CCC projects to be part of the Outreachy program.

It\'s open source, based on Node.js, and has managed hosting. We also looked into WordPress - which is the \\"standard - but one key advantage of Ghost is that it provides native support for email newsletters. It manages members and subscriptions and allows you to segment the user base. Other advantages of Ghost include: a) native markdown support, b) a more minimalist approach, and c) a more modern architecture. It also provides webhooks and a REST API for integrations. By the next meeting, we should have the Enarx Blog up and running.\\n\\n## CCC\\nAshley and Ben both added the Outreachy proposal to the agenda of the CCC Outreach and TAC meetings.

It is written in Rust and aims to reduce the number of trust relationships required when running executables in the private or public cloud. It currently supports AMD SEV, and this session will: a) Discuss SEV capabilities and roadmap; b) Introduce the Enarx architecture; c) Present some of the components of Enarx; d) Show a demonstration of an early set of Enarx capabilities.\\n\\n**Source**: Linux Security Summit 2019\\n\\n**Link**: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-ISmJNxGiY"},{"id":"2019-08-15-trust-no-one-run-everywhere-introducing-enarx","metadata":{"permalink":"/resources/2019-08-15-trust-no-one-run-everywhere-introducing-enarx","source":"@site/resources/2019-08-15-trust-no-one-run-everywhere-introducing-enarx.md","title":"Trust No One, Run Everywhere\u2013Introducing Enarx","description":"When you run a workload as a VM, container or in a serverless environment, that workload is vulnerable to interference by any person or software with hypervisor, root or kernel access.\xa0 Enarx, a new open source project,\xa0 aims to make it simple to deploy workloads to a variety of trusted execution environments (TEEs) in the public cloud, on your premises or elsewhere, and to ensure that your application workload is as secure as possible.","date":"2019-08-15T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"August 15, 2019","tags":[{"label":"Red Hat\'s Blog","permalink":"/resources/tags/red-hats-blog"}],"truncated":false,"authors":[{"name":"Mike Bursell","title":"Co-founder of Enarx","url":"https://github.com/MikeCamel","imageURL":"https://github.com/MikeCamel.png","key":"mike"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"2019-08-15-trust-no-one-run-everywhere-introducing-enarx","title":"Trust No One, Run Everywhere\u2013Introducing Enarx","authors":["mike"],"tags":["Red Hat\'s Blog"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Enarx -
