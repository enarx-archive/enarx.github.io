Nick is coordinating with Ashley and the Linux Foundation to configure DNS for blog.enarx.dev. First post about the New Custodian was published yesterday at:\\n\\nhttps://enarx.ghost.io/\\n\\n### Enarx Keeploader\\n\\nAs we are getting ready for our first release, Nathaniel has recommended that we give more visibility to [enarx-keepldr](https://github.com/enarx/enarx-keepldr). We also heard feedback from new users who couldn\'t find their way around running enarx just by looking at the current [enarx/enarx](https://github.com/enarx/enarx) github repo. That\'s because there is no actual enarx code there, just documentation. So the proposal is to move the enarx/enarx-keepldr code to enarx/enarx, and keep the documentation on enarx/enarx under the wiki. Here\'s a brief action plan:\\n1. Move keepldr code to enarx/enarx (maintains git history)\\n1. Remove docs folder from enarx/enarx, and move it to the wiki\\n1. Move keepldr wiki (2 pages) to enarx/enarx wiki\\n1. Transfer keepldr issues to enarx/enarx\\n1. Transfer enarx/enarx non-code issues to enarx/outreach\\n1. PRs can still get merged across repos (from keepldr to enarx/enarx)\\n\\n### Vulnerability Disclosure and Embargo Policy\\n\\nThe CCC has again urgently requested that all CCC projects have a disclosure policy. I sent a PR to adopt the Vulnerability Disclosure and Embargo Policy proposed by axel:\\n\\nhttps://github.com/enarx/rfcs/tree/master/00002-vulnerability-disclosure-and-embargo-policy\\n\\n\\n## CCC\\nThe TAC has approved Enarx and other CCC projects to be part of the Outreachy program. Besides the benefits of the program itself, another benefit is bringing the CCC projects closer together to collaborate and grow their communities. \\n\\n### Outreachy\\nThe Outreachy community application deadline was extended to October 6. Nick and Ashley already filled out the application.\\n\\nhttps://github.com/enarx/outreach/issues/15\\n\\nhttps://www.outreachy.org/\\n\\n### Hacktoberfest\\nHacktoberfest\'s website is now live.

To better develop, deploy, and run secure applications on a TEE platform such as Intel\'s SGX, both academic and industrial teams have devoted much effort to developing reliable and convenient TEE containers. In this paper, we studied the isolation strategies of 15 existing TEE containers to protect secure applications from potentially malicious operating systems (OS) or untrusted applications, using a semi-automatic approach combining a feedback-guided analyzer with manual code review. Our analysis reveals the isolation protection each of these TEE containers enforces, and their security weaknesses. We observe that none of the existing TEE containers can fulfill the goal they set, due to various pitfalls in their design and implementation. We report the lessons learnt from our study for guiding the development of more secure containers, and further discuss thetrend of TEE container designs.

It\'s open source, based on Node.js, and has managed hosting. We also looked into WordPress - which is the \\"standard - but one key advantage of Ghost is that it provides native support for email newsletters. It manages members and subscriptions and allows you to segment the user base. Other advantages of Ghost include: a) native markdown support, b) a more minimalist approach, and c) a more modern architecture. It also provides webhooks and a REST API for integrations.

It\u2019s a modern variation of a familiar challenge: balancing security and privacy with usability. While placing and processing intellectual property on shared servers is fraught, experts say the risk can and must be managed. That\u2019s the aim of a new cross-industry effort, the Confidential Computing Consortium. Founded in 2019, the collaboration operates within The Linux Foundation.
